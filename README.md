# 🌍Overview

This tool is a work in progress procedural road system designed to eliminate the need for manual 3D road modeling or mapping.

The road layout is controlled by an editable spline, allowing you to easily adjust curves, direction, and flow to fit your environment. No premade road models are required, the length, width, and overall shape of the road are automatically generated using customizable parameters.

This system also procedurally handles sidewalks, decals, and streetlights placement, removing the need to manually place props along the road. All elements adapt dynamically based on the road’s configuration.
